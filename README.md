Features include:
+ Base player (player 01): just like any other snake game
+ Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard and Asian ðŸ˜‚)
+ High score storage in a database (mighty convenient)

+ âœ¨ Multiplayer mode ! ðŸ’Žâœ¨

(All configured in code to be easy to modify)




For those interested in moding the game:
Pre requirments:
  - Both [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed
  - Make sure to install the imported librarys (pygame and sqlite)
  - Git

    $ mkdir Snake_Game
    $ cd Snake_Game/
